Instead of storing an on-chain whitelist of attendees, your backend or event organizer signs a message for each approved guest. When attendees arrive, they submit their signed message to the smart contract to prove they were invited. The contract uses `ecrecover` to verify the signature on-chain, confirming their identity without needing any prior on-chain registration. This pattern drastically reduces gas costs, keeps the contract lightweight, and mirrors how many real-world events handle off-chain approvals with on-chain validation — a practical Web3 authentication flow.",

Imagine you're creating a decentralized version of Fort Knox — users lock up tokenized gold, and can later withdraw it. But just like a real vault, this contract must prevent attackers from repeatedly triggering the withdrawal logic before the balance updates. You'll implement the `nonReentrant` modifier to block reentry attempts, and follow Solidity security best practices to lock down your contract. This project shows how a seemingly simple withdrawal function can become a vulnerability — and how to defend it properly.",
